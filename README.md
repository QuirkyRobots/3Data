## Browser Security Policies & Performance

### Brave

* If you are using Brave, you'll likely have to turn shields off and repeat this if you clear browsing data (see below image).
* To avoid this, you can untick the "Site and shields settings" box in the setting (see below image).

### Ad Blockers and Other Browsers

* If you don't see any values in the scene, please check that your browser and VPN security policies allow ARRR 3D to communicate with the CoinGecko API.
### Sound

*  Because of browser built-in sound security policies, sounds may not play on first launch, until you have interacted with the page.
*  Some sound consistancy issues have been detected on FireFox. This is being investigated.

### Performance

* Please make sure you have "hardware acceleration" turned on in your browser settings (see below image).
* Due to the complex 3D modelling, the scene might be sluggish on some older devices and some mobiles. A performance option is coming soon.
