# ARRR 3D v2

A simple to use and fun, 3D web app for showing live [ARRR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pirate-chain) cryptocurrency data, built with native [Three.js](https://threejs.org)

## Make a Theme

Make your own unique theme and share it on Twitter/X with the hashtag #ARRR3D

## Instructions

* Use the buttons at the top to highlight a specific data point.
* Set a custom message on the cube using the message text input.
* Theme the text, cube, and background using the colour pickers, and adjust transparency with the opacity slider.
* Use the two default theme buttons to revert to the default themes.
* Use the copy theme button to copy the data URL, which contains all your theme settings, including the custom message.
* Tick the wireframe box to view the cube in wireframe mode and adjust the mesh detail by selecting vertices.

  
* If you have any issues, please view the [security](#browser-security-policies--performance) below.

## Coming Soon

* Mobile compatible control panel.
* Background image picker.
* Premade theme list.
* Auto reduced performance for mobile devices.

## Limitations

## Browser Security Policies & Performance

### Brave

* If you are using Brave, you will likely have to turn your shields off and repeat this process if you clear your browsing data (see below image).
* You to avoid having to keep turn the shields on after clearing browser data, you can until the "Site and shields settings" box in the setting (see below image).

### Ad Blockers and Other Browsers

* If you don't see any values in the scene, please check that your browser and VPN security policies allow ARRR 3D to communicate with the CoinGecko API.

### Performance

* Please make sure you have "hardware acceleration" turned on in your browser settings (see below image).
* Due to the complex 3D modelling, the sense might be sluggish on some older devices and some mobiles. A performance option is coming soon.
